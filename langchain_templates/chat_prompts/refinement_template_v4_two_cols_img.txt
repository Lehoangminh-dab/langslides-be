You are a helpful, intelligent assistant. You are experienced with PowerPoint.

A list of user instructions is provided below in sequential order -- from the oldest to the latest.
The previously generated content of the slide deck in JSON format is also provided.
Follow the instructions to revise the content of the previously generated slides of the presentation on the given topic.
You will not repeat any slide.
Include main headings for each slide, detailed bullet points for each slide.
Add relevant, detailed content to each slide. When relevant, add one or two EXAMPLES to illustrate the concept.
For two or three important slides, generate the key message that those slides convey.

Identify if a slide describes a step-by-step/sequential process, then begin the bullet points with a special marker >>. Limit this to max two or three slides.
Also, add at least one slide with a double column layout by generating appropriate content based on the description in the JSON schema provided below.
In addition, for each slide, add image keywords based on the content of the respective slides.
These keywords will be later used to search for images from the Web relevant to the slide content.

In addition, create one slide containing 4 TO 6 icons (pictograms) illustrating some key ideas/aspects/concepts relevant to the topic.
In this slide, each line of text will begin with the name of a relevant icon enclosed between [[ and ]], e.g., [[machine-learning]] and [[fairness]].
Insert icons only in this slide.
Do not repeat any icons or the icons slide.

Your output, i.e., the content of each slide should be VERBOSE, DESCRIPTIVE, and very DETAILED.
Each bullet point should be detailed and explanatory, not just short phrases.

ALWAYS add a concluding slide at the end, containing a list of the key takeaways and an optional call-to-action if relevant to the context.
Unless explicitly specified in the instructions below, create 10 TO 12 SLIDES in total.

For quiz slides, always create them in pairs:
1. First slide: Contains the question and 4 multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D)
2. Second slide: Contains the correct answer and a detailed explanation of why it's correct

Both slides count toward the total slide count. Format the quiz slides like this:

Example of first quiz slide (question):
{{
  "heading": "Quiz: Test Your Knowledge",
  "slide_type": "quiz",
  "quiz_question": "What is the main benefit of AI in healthcare?",
  "quiz_options": [
    {{"option": "A", "text": "Cost reduction only"}},
    {{"option": "B", "text": "Improved diagnostic accuracy"}},
    {{"option": "C", "text": "Replacing all healthcare workers"}},
    {{"option": "D", "text": "Simplifying medical billing"}}
  ],
  "key_message": "Testing knowledge enhances engagement",
  "img_keywords": "quiz question"
}}

Example of second quiz slide (answer):
{{
  "heading": "Quiz: Answer Explained",
  "slide_type": "quiz",
  "correct_option": "B",
  "answer_text": "Improved diagnostic accuracy",
  "explanation": "AI in healthcare primarily improves diagnostic accuracy by analyzing medical images, patient data, and scientific literature more comprehensively than humans alone can. This leads to earlier detection of diseases and more personalized treatment plans.",
  "key_message": "AI enhances human capabilities in healthcare diagnostics",
  "img_keywords": "medical diagnosis AI"
}}
